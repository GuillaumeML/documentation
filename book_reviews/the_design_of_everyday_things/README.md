# The Design of Everyday Things

## 1. The psychopathology of everyday things
### The complexity of modern devices
All artificial things are designed. Things like tha layout of furniture in a room, the path through a garden or forest. Things that have been designed do not need to be physical. Abstract things like lectures, services, organizational structures of a business have a design that is consciously designed or not. Design is a relatively new field but everything can be designed. Things like clothes, furniture, control rooms or bridges have to be designed. Well designed things ensure that the product actually fulfills human needs while being understandable and usable. Bonus points if they are delightful and enjoyable. The whole experience needs to be paid attention. The major areas of design relevant to this book are industrial design, interaction design and experience design. None of them are well defined. 
 - Industrial design is the professional service of creating, developing concepts and specification that optimize value, appearance of products and systems to benefit the user and the manufacturer. 
 - Interaction design focuses on the interaction between people and technology to enhance people's understanding of what can be done, what is happening and what occured. Draws upon priciples of psychology, design, art, emotion to ensure a good experience. 
 - Experience design is about designing products, processes, events, environments with a focus on the quality of the whole experience. 

Design is concerned with the nature of interaction between people and technology. It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people. Most of the problems come from a complete lack of design principles understanding. Engineers are often tasked with designing things but also often make the mistake of thinking that logical explanations are sufficient. We have to embrace the human behaviour the way it is and not the way we wish it could be. We must design our machines on the assumption that people will make errors. 
### Human-Centered Design
Human centered design is an approach that puts human needs, capabilities and behaviours first, then designs to accomodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving. A good understanding of technology and psychology are necessary. Good design requires good communication, especially from machine to person indicating what actions are possible, what is happening, and what is going to happen. Communication is especially is especially important when things go wrong. Designers need to focus their attention on the cases where things go wrong, not just when everything goes well. Getting the specification of the thing to be defined is one of the most difficult parts of the design. One of the principle behind is to avoid specifying the problem as long as possible and instead iterate upon repeated approximations. 
### Fundamental Principles of interction
Great designers produce pleasurable experiences. It is critical because it determines how fondly people remember their interactions. Discoverability is about how users find out what operations are possible. Discoverabilty results from the following five psychological principals: affordances, signifiers, constraints, mappings and feedback. There is a sixth one, the most important of all called the conceptual model of the system. 
### Affordances
Affordance refers to the relationship between a psychological object and a person. A chair affords ("is for") support, therefore, affords sitting. Most chairs can be carried by a single person ("they afford lifting"), but some can only be lifted by a strong man or by a team of people so a if a young or weak person cannot lift the chair, then the chair does not have that affordance for thoses people and does not afford lifting. The presence of an affordance is jointly determined by the qualities of the object and the abilities of the agent that is interacting. Affordance is a relationship. We can talk also about anti-affordance for some materials like glass. Glass afford transparency by it has the anti-affordancy of blocking passage. Affordances exist even if they are not visible. For designers, their visibility is critical because they provide string clues on the operations of things. A flat plate on a door affords pushing. A slot affords inserting things into etc. 
### Signifiers
Affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the actions should take place. People search for clues and signs that help them understand. Designers must provide them those clues and those clues are called signifiers. Signifiers refers to any mark or sound or any perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavious to a person. Signifiers can be deliberate or intentional but can be accidental and unintentional. For example, if enough people walks through a forest a trail will emerge and this happens overtime with usage and becomes a signifier by accident. 
### Mapping
Mapping comes from mathematics and is about the relationship between two sets of things. Mapping is an important concept in the design and layout of controls and displays. For exmple, to control a row of 5 lights, a good mapping would be a row of 5 switches where each switch is mapped to the light row in order. Related controls should be grouped together and controls should be close to the item being controlled. Good design takes care, planning, thought, and an unerstanding of how people behave. 
### Feedback
Feedback is communicating the results of an action. Feedback must be immediate and must be informative. Poor feedback can be worse than no feedback. Too much feedback can be even more annoying then too little. Feedback is essential, but not when it gets in the way of other things including a calm e=and relaxing environment. Feedback has to be planned. 
### Conceptual models
A conceptual model is an explanation, usually simplified, of how something works. Does not have to be complete or accurate as long as it is useful. Simplified models are valuable only as long as the assumptions that supports them are true. They are mental models. A mental model is defined as a conceptual model that represents somebodies understanding of how things work. Usually, the model is constructed by experience. Quite often the models are erroneous and lead to difficulties in using the device. 
### The system Image
People create mental models of themselves, others, things with which they interact etc. The models are forged through experience, training and instruction. These models help us acheive our goals and understand the world. The combination of available information that helps us build the conceptual model is called the system image. Ã¹the designer's conceptual model is the designer's conception of the look, feel, and operation of a product. The system image is what can be derived from the physical structure that has been built (including documentation). The user's mental model is developed though interaction with the product and system image. Designers expect the user's model to be identical to their own, but because the cannot communicate directly with the user, the burden of communication is with the system image. 
### The paradox of technology
The same technology that simplifies life by providing more functions in each devices also complicates ife by making the device harder to learn, harder to use.
### The design challenge
Design requires the cooperative efforts of multiple disciplines. Great designers, great management etc. One discipline argues that it must be usable and understandable, another that is must be attractive, another that it must be cheap, another that it must be reliable and another that it must be cheap. What good is a product if nobody uses it. Successful products satisfies all these requirements. 

## 2. The psychology of everyday actions
### How people do things: The gulfs of Execution and Evaluation
When people use something, they face two gulfs. Gulf of execution when they try to figure out how it operates and gulf of evaluation where they try to figure out what happened. The goal of the designer is to help people bridge the two gulfs. The major design elements that help bridge the gulf of execution are signifiers, contraints, mappings, and a conceptual model. The major design elements that help bridge the gulf of evaluation are feedback and a good conceptual model. 

### The seven stages of action

1. Goal (form the goal)
2. Plan (the action)
3. Specify (an action of sequence)
4. Perform (the action of sequence)
5. Perceive (the state of the world)
6. Interpret (the perception)
7. Compare (the outcome with the goal)

The seven-stage action cycle is simplified but ot provides a useful framework for understanding human action and for guiding design. 

### Human thought: mostly subconscious

#### Subconscious and Conscious Systems of Cognition
| Subconscious        | Conscious           |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| fast      | slow | 
| multiple resources     | limited resources      | 
| controls skilled behaviour | invoked for novel situations: when learning, when in danger, when things go wrong     | 

### Human Cognition and Emotion
The following is an oversimplification but still a good enough approximation to provide guidance in understanding human behaviour. There are three levels of processing: visceral, behavioural and reflective. 

#### The visceral processing level
This is refered to as the lizard brain. Making quick judgments about the environment: good or bad, safe or dangerous. Visceral system allows us to repond quickly and subconsciously, without awareness or control. It simply assesses the situatio: no cause is assigned, no blame, and no credit. For designers, the visceral response is about immediate perception: the pleasantness of a mellow, harmonious sound or a horrible sound. Here is where the style matters: appearances, wether sound or sight, touch or smell, drive the visceral response. 

#### The behavioural processing level

Behavioural level is the home of learned skills, triggered by situations that match the appropriate patterns. This level is mostly subconscious. Things like catching a ball, stiking out your tongue etc. For the designers, the most critical aspect of the behavioural level is that every action is associated with an expectation. Behavioural states are learned. They give rise to a feeling of control when there is a good understanding and knowledge of results, and frustration and anger when things do not go as planned, and especially when neither the reason nor the possible remedies are known. Feedback is critical to managing expectations and a good design provides this. The release of the of the tension of expectation creates a sense of releif. 

#### The reflective processing level

The reflective level is the home of conscious cognition. Place where reasoning and conscious decision-making take place. Reflection is cognitive, deep and slow. It occurs after the events have happened. It is a reflectionor looking back over them, evaluating the circumstances, actions and outcomes, often assessing blame or responsibility. This is where predictions of the future take place. 

#### Design must take place at all levels: visceral, behavioural, and reflective
To the designer, reflection is perhaps the most important of the levels of processing. Memories last far longer than the immediate experience or the period of usage, which are the domains of the visceral and behavioral levels. It is reflection that drives us to recommend a product, to recommend that others use it-or perhaps to avoid it. 
All three levels of processing work together to determine a person's cognitive and emotional state. 

### The seven stages of action and the three levels of processing
The stages of action can readily be associated with the three different levels of processing. At the lowest level are the visceral levels of calmness or anxiety when approaching a task or evaluating  the state of the world. In the middle level are the behavioural one driven be expectations on the execution and the emotions driven by the confirmation of those expectations. 

### People as storytellers
People are innately disposed to look for causes of events, to form explanations and stories. Conceptual models are a form of story, resulting from our predisposition to find explanations. These models are essential in helping us understand our experiences, predict the outcomes of our actions, and handle unexpected occurences. Conceptual models are often constructed from fragmentary evidence, with only a poor understanding of what is happening, and with a kind of naive psychology that postulates causes, mechanisms, and relationships even where there are none. 

### Blaming the wrong things
People try to find causes for events. They tend to assign a causal relation whenever two things occur in succession. Suppose I try to use an everyday thing, but I can't. Who is at fault: me or the thing? We are apt to blame ourselves, especially if other are able to use it. Lack of feedback can lead to unintended results. With electronic devices, people are often led to conclude that actions were not recorded so people redo the same actions which  might intensify or be queud up and actionned later on which might cause harm or distress or frustration. Modern systems try to provide feedback in less then 0.1 seconds. Usually, the presence of an hourglass or rotating clock hands is a reasuring sign that work is in progress. Some studies show that it is wise to underpredict. That helps manage expectations and can lead to a hppy result. 

#### Learned helplessness
Learned helplessness is a phenomenom that might explain the self-blame. It referes to situation where people experience repeated failure at a task. As a result, they decide that the task cannot be done, at least not by them so they are hepless. 

#### Positive psychology
We learned to give up after repeated failure. But we can learn optimistic and positive responses to life. We need to remove the word failure and replace it with learning experience. To fail is to learn. Tips from the design firm Ideo:
 - Do not blame people when they fail to use your products properly
 - Take peopl's difficulties as signifiers of where the product can be improved
 - Eliminate all error message from electronic or computer systems. Instead, provide help and guidance.
 - Make it possible to correct problems directly from help and guidance messages. Allow people to continue with their tasks: Don't impede progress-help make it smooth and continuous. Never make people start over.
 - Assume that what people have done is partially correct, so if it is innapropriate, provide the guidance that allows them to correct the problem and be on their way.
 - Think positively, for yourself and for the people you interact with.

### Falsely blaming yourelf
When people make errors, invariably people feel guilty and either try to hide the error or blame themselves for stupidity or clumsiness. Eliminate the term human error. Instead, talk about communication and interaction: what we call error is usually bad communication or interaction. Machines are not people so they can't communicate and understand like people do so this means the designers have a special obligation to ensure that the behaviour of machines is understandable to the people who interact with them. Designers should strive to minimize the chance of innapropriate actions in the first place by using affordances, signifiers, good mapping, and constraints to guide the actions. If a person performs an inappropriate action, the design should maximize the chance that this can be discovered and then rectified. This requires good, intelligible feedback coupled with a simple, clear conceptual model. When people understand what has happened, what state the system is in, and what the most appropriate set of actions is, they can perform their activities more effectively. 

### How technology can accomodate human behaviour
In the past, cost prevented many manufacturers from providing useful feedback that would assist people in forming accurate conceptual models. But now the cost of sensors and displays has dropped making it now possible to do a lot more. 

### The seven stages of action: seven fundamental design principals

1. What do I want to accomplish?
2. What are the alternative sequences?
3. What action can I do now?
4. How do I do it?
5. What happened?
6. What does it mean?
7. Is this okay? Have I accomplished my goal?

### The seven fundamental principles of design:

1. Discoverability. Is it possible to determine what actions are possible anf the current state of the device
2. Feedback: There is full and continuous information about the resutls of actions and the current state of the product or service. After an action has been executed, it is easy to determine the new state.
3. Conceptual model. The design projects all the information needed to create a good conceptual model of the system, leading to understanding and a feeling of control. The conceptual model enhances both discoverability and evaluation of results.
4. Affordances. The proper affordances exist to make the desired actions possible.
5. Signifiers. Effective use of signifiers ensures discoverability and that the feedback is well communicated an intelligible.
6. Mappings. The relationship between controls ant their actions follows the principles of good mapping, enhanced as much as possible through spatial layout and temporal contiguity
7. Constraints. Providing physical logical, semantic, and cultural constraints guides actions and eases interpretation.

## 3. Knowledge in the head and in the world

## 4. Knowing what to do: constraints, discoverability, and feedback

## 5. Human error? No, bad design

## 6. Design thinking

## 7. Design in the world of business
