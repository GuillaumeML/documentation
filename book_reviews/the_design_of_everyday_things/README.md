# The Design of Everyday Things

## 1. The psychopathology of everyday things
### The complexity of modern devices
All artificial things are designed. Things like tha layout of furniture in a room, the path through a garden or forest. Things that have been designed do not need to be physical. Abstract things like lectures, services, organizational structures of a business have a design that is consciously designed or not. Design is a relatively new field but everything can be designed. Things like clothes, furniture, control rooms or bridges have to be designed. Well designed things ensure that the product actually fulfills human needs while being understandable and usable. Bonus points if they are delightful and enjoyable. The whole experience needs to be paid attention. The major areas of design relevant to this book are industrial design, interaction design and experience design. None of them are well defined. 
 - Industrial design is the professional service of creating, developing concepts and specification that optimize value, appearance of products and systems to benefit the user and the manufacturer. 
 - Interaction design focuses on the interaction between people and technology to enhance people's understanding of what can be done, what is happening and what occured. Draws upon priciples of psychology, design, art, emotion to ensure a good experience. 
 - Experience design is about designing products, processes, events, environments with a focus on the quality of the whole experience. 

Design is concerned with the nature of interaction between people and technology. It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people. Most of the problems come from a complete lack of design principles understanding. Engineers are often tasked with designing things but also often make the mistake of thinking that logical explanations are sufficient. We have to embrace the human behaviour the way it is and not the way we wish it could be. We must design our machines on the assumption that people will make errors. 
### Human-Centered Design
Human centered design is an approach that puts human needs, capabilities and behaviours first, then designs to accomodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving. A good understanding of technology and psychology are necessary. Good design requires good communication, especially from machine to person indicating what actions are possible, what is happening, and what is going to happen. Communication is especially is especially important when things go wrong. Designers need to focus their attention on the cases where things go wrong, not just when everything goes well. Getting the specification of the thing to be defined is one of the most difficult parts of the design. One of the principle behind is to avoid specifying the problem as long as possible and instead iterate upon repeated approximations. 
### Fundamental Principles of interction
Great designers produce pleasurable experiences. It is critical because it determines how fondly people remember their interactions. Discoverability is about how users find out what operations are possible. Discoverabilty results from the following five psychological principals: affordances, signifiers, constraints, mappings and feedback. There is a sixth one, the most important of all called the conceptual model of the system. 
### Affordances
Affordance refers to the relationship between a psychological object and a person. A chair affords ("is for") support, therefore, affords sitting. Most chairs can be carried by a single person ("they afford lifting"), but some can only be lifted by a strong man or by a team of people so a if a young or weak person cannot lift the chair, then the chair does not have that affordance for thoses people and does not afford lifting. The presence of an affordance is jointly determined by the qualities of the object and the abilities of the agent that is interacting. Affordance is a relationship. We can talk also about anti-affordance for some materials like glass. Glass afford transparency by it has the anti-affordancy of blocking passage. Affordances exist even if they are not visible. For designers, their visibility is critical because they provide string clues on the operations of things. A flat plate on a door affords pushing. A slot affords inserting things into etc. 
### Signifiers
Affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the actions should take place. People search for clues and signs that help them understand. Designers must provide them those clues and those clues are called signifiers. Signifiers refers to any mark or sound or any perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavious to a person. Signifiers can be deliberate or intentional but can be accidental and unintentional. For example, if enough people walks through a forest a trail will emerge and this happens overtime with usage and becomes a signifier by accident. 
### Mapping
Mapping comes from mathematics and is about the relationship between two sets of things. Mapping is an important concept in the design and layout of controls and displays. For exmple, to control a row of 5 lights, a good mapping would be a row of 5 switches where each switch is mapped to the light row in order. Related controls should be grouped together and controls should be close to the item being controlled. Good design takes care, planning, thought, and an unerstanding of how people behave. 
### Feedback
Feedback is communicating the results of an action. Feedback must be immediate and must be informative. Poor feedback can be worse than no feedback. Too much feedback can be even more annoying then too little. Feedback is essential, but not when it gets in the way of other things including a calm e=and relaxing environment. Feedback has to be planned. 
### Conceptual models
A conceptual model is an explanation, usually simplified, of how something works. Does not have to be complete or accurate as long as it is useful. Simplified models are valuable only as long as the assumptions that supports them are true. They are mental models. A mental model is defined as a conceptual model that represents somebodies understanding of how things work. Usually, the model is constructed by experience. Quite often the models are erroneous and lead to difficulties in using the device. 
### The system Image
People create mental models of themselves, others, things with which they interact etc. The models are forged through experience, training and instruction. These models help us acheive our goals and understand the world. The combination of available information that helps us build the conceptual model is called the system image. Ã¹the designer's conceptual model is the designer's conception of the look, feel, and operation of a product. The system image is what can be derived from the physical structure that has been built (including documentation). The user's mental model is developed though interaction with the product and system image. Designers expect the user's model to be identical to their own, but because the cannot communicate directly with the user, the burden of communication is with the system image. 
### The paradox of technology
The same technology that simplifies life by providing more functions in each devices also complicates ife by making the device harder to learn, harder to use.
### The design challenge
Design requires the cooperative efforts of multiple disciplines. Great designers, great management etc. One discipline argues that it must be usable and understandable, another that is must be attractive, another that it must be cheap, another that it must be reliable and another that it must be cheap. What good is a product if nobody uses it. Successful products satisfies all these requirements.
