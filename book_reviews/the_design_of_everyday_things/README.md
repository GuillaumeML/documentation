# The Design of Everyday Things

## 1. The psychopathology of everyday things
### The complexity of modern devices
All artificial things are designed. Things like tha layout of furniture in a room, the path through a garden or forest. Things that have been designed do not need to be physical. Abstract things like lectures, services, organizational structures of a business have a design that is consciously designed or not. Design is a relatively new field but everything can be designed. Things like clothes, furniture, control rooms or bridges have to be designed. Well designed things ensure that the product actually fulfills human needs while being understandable and usable. Bonus points if they are delightful and enjoyable. The whole experience needs to be paid attention. The major areas of design relevant to this book are industrial design, interaction design and experience design. None of them are well defined. 
 - Industrial design is the professional service of creating, developing concepts and specification that optimize value, appearance of products and systems to benefit the user and the manufacturer. 
 - Interaction design focuses on the interaction between people and technology to enhance people's understanding of what can be done, what is happening and what occured. Draws upon priciples of psychology, design, art, emotion to ensure a good experience. 
 - Experience design is about designing products, processes, events, environments with a focus on the quality of the whole experience. 

Design is concerned with the nature of interaction between people and technology. It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people. Most of the problems come from a complete lack of design principles understanding. Engineers are often tasked with designing things but also often make the mistake of thinking that logical explanations are sufficient. We have to embrace the human behaviour the way it is and not the way we wish it could be. We must design our machines on the assumption that people will make errors.
