## 5. You already know
### 1. Write out your story a step at a time
You can write stories by writing down on sticky notes all the actions you take to reach a particular outcome
### Tasks are what we do
The actions all start with a verb. With software, they are called user tasks. User tasks are the basic building blocks of a story map. 
### My tasks are different than yours
People are different from one another and the differences will be expressed in the way they choose to do things. People using your software may have different goals when using it. They may use it in different contexts so we need to take into account when designing the software. 
### I'm just more detail-oriented
Tasks are like rocks. You can break down a big rock with a hammer. Example, "make breakfast" could be broken down to "Put bread in toaster" and "Pour a glass of juice". There are different levels of tasks. Tasks can be broken down in sub-tasks and tasks can be aggregated into summary level tasks. Use the goal-level concept to help you aggregate small tasks or decompose large tasks. 
### 2. Organize Your Story
Tasks should be organized from left-to-right. The left-to-right order is the narrative flow. 
### Fill in missing details
This arrangement allows us to see the whole big story and allows us to see the parts of the story that are missing. 
### 3. Explore Alternative Stories
Start playing the what if game to see the alternatives. Details, alternatives, variations, and excpeptions fill in the body of a map
### Keep the flow
You can tell a story in a different bunch of ways. You can tell the story when for the day everything went right and you can tell the story of the day everything went wrong. If you do the excercie with bunch of people, you will argue about the order of the tasks or the tasks themselves so trying to reach consensus is pointless since some things are a matter of preferences. Some other things are not a matter of preferences for example, "Geting dressed" before "Taking a shower". 
### 4. Distill your map to make a backbone
Once you have mapped the tasks, your map should look like the spine and ribs of a little weird animal. You should be able to cluster the tasks that seem to go together to reach the bigger goal. Write on a post-it of a different color a short verb phrase that distills all the tasks underneath it. These will be called activities. They organize a bunch of tasks done by similar people at similar times in order to reach a particular goal. The activities should be in a narrative flow and forms the backbone of the map. Activities aggregate tasks directed at a common goal. It is normal for activities to be hard to name so activities should be called whatever the customers call it. 
### 5. Slice out tasks that help you reach a specific outcome
Use the map to imagine a task that didn't happen. For example, if we were to map the tasks related to getting prepared for work and you forgot to set the alarm the night before, you would write on a sticky note "Get out the door in a few minutes" on a sticky note and placve it to the left of the map near the top. Now try to slice the map to remove the tasks that does not help reach the goal of "Getting out in a few minutes". Now go back through the flow and fill in tasks that are missing and that you would do if you were late. Try doing the same excercice with different goals and you will see the different tasks that help you reach the different goals. 
### That's it! You've learned all the important concepts
 - Tasks are short verb phrases that describes what people do
 - Tasks have different goal levels
 - Tasks in a map are arranged in a left-to-right narrative flow
 - The depth of a map contains variations and alternative tasks
 - Tasks are organized by activities across the top of the map
 - Activities form the backbone of the map
 - You can slice the map to identify the tasks you'll need to reach a specific outcome 
### Do try this at home, or at work
Try the "morning routine map" excercise if you're trying out mapping for the first time in your organization. You'll all learn the basics and be weel your way to being able to map anything. 
### It's a now map, not a later map
You can build maps to understand how people work today. You can add other things to the map like: pains (things that don't work, parts people hate), gains (The fun things, the things that make it worth doing), questions (why people do this? What's going on when they do?) and ideas (Things people could do, or what we could build that would take away pain, or make the joys better). 
### Try this for real
When trying this with real customers that talk about how they do their jobs, they might all come up with different tasks. This is okay because the discussions that emerge are contributing to building shared understanding. It is from the now map that you can start translating this map into future software. 
### With Software it's harder
Building a map is hard if you don't know who your users are and what they do. If so, you need to learn more about people and what they do. Better yet, work directly with them to create a map. 

#### Six simple steps to story mapping
1. Frame the problem. Who is it for, and why are we building it?
2. Map the big picture. Focuse on breadth, not depth. 
3. Explore. Go deep and talk about other types of users and people, how else the might do things, and the kinds of things that can go wrong. 
4. Slice out a release strategy. There's always too much to build. Focus on what you're trying to achieve for your business, and the peopl the product will serve. 
5. Slice out a learning strategy. Use the map and discussion to help find your biggest risks. Slice the map into smaller minimum viable product experiments to learn from users. 
6. Slice out a development strategy. Focus on building things earl that help you learn to spot technical issues and development risks sooner. 
### The map is just the beginning
Use storytelling with words and pictures to build shared understanding. Don't just talk about what to build: talk about who will use it and why so you can minimize outcome. 

## 6. The real story about stories
### Kent' disruptively simple idea
One of the biggest problems in software development is that different people can read the same document and imagine different things. Lot's of people call this lack of understanding "bad requirements". Documents usually describes what we need but not why we need it. The best solutions come from collaboration between the people with the problems to solve and the people who can solve them. Stop trying to write the perfect document and get together to write stories. Stories get their name not from how they're supposed to be written, but from how they are supposed to be used. 

### Simple isn't easy
You know you are telling stories right if you're generating energy, interest, and vision in the listener's mind. If you are not getting together to have rich discussions about your stories, then you're not really using stories. 

### Ron Jeffries and the 3 Cs
Card: Write what you'd like to see in the software on a bunch of index cards.

Conversation: Get together and have a rich conversation about what software to build

Confirmation: Together agree on how you'll confirm that the software is done. 

### Words and pictures

Conversatio  goes best if it includes lots of things such as simple personas, workflow diagrams, UI sketches, and other traditional software model that'll help explain things. Take photos before you leave so you can recall the details of the conversation that would be difficult to write down. 
### That's it
Using the 3 C's method can change everything, or it also can't if you are working with people used to working in the old fashion way. The next chapter will explain how to make conversations go better.
